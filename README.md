## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24.3+, http, Gin framework, GORM, PostgreSQL, gRPC, Protocol Buffers
- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.32.1+, Riverpod(Bloc), HTTP client, gRPC client
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17.5+, database migrations
- **Testing**: Go testing, Flutter testing, integration tests

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git installed and configured
- Go 1.24.3+ installed
- Flutter 3.32.1+ installed
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- PostgreSQL client 

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Fork this repository to your GitHub account
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sum25-go-flutter-course.git
cd sum25-go-flutter-course

# Install dependencies
make setup

# Start development environment
make dev
```

## 📋 Submission Workflow

This course uses a **fork-and-merge-request** workflow similar to real software development:

### 1. Fork and Setup
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Add upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/timur-harin/sum25-go-flutter-course.git`

### 2. Lab Submission Process
1. Create a new branch for each lab: `git checkout -b lab01-surname-name` - all lowercase, no spaces, like in Moodle
2. Complete the lab requirements in the appropriate `labs/labXX/` directory
3. Ensure all tests pass: `make test`
4. Ensure code passes linting: `make lint`
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Create a Merge Request to the main repository
7. Wait for automated CI checks, peer review and instructor review

### 3. Code Review Process
- **Automated Checks**: CI pipeline runs tests, linting, and builds
- **Peer Review**: Other students review your code (required)
- **Instructor Review**: Spot-checks for edge cases and learning objectives
- **Continuous Integration**: All changes must pass automated tests
