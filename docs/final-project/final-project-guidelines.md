# Final project guidelines: Cross-platform Health & Wellness application

## Overview
This final project is designed as a team-based endeavor (2-5 students) to create a comprehensive cross-platform health and wellness application. Teams will apply all concepts learned throughout the course to deliver a production-ready solution.

> Note: Alternative themes may be proposed but must receive instructor approval.

## Possible project topics
1. Sleep tracking application
2. First aid kit companion
3. Hydration (Aqua) tracking
4. Fitness tracking hub
5. Nutrition management
6. Mental health companion
7. Cold shower training
8. Habit formation assistant
9. Posture improvement coach
10. Stress management system
11. ...

> Teams are encouraged to combine elements from different topics or propose entirely new ideas with instructor approval. Focus should be on creating a cohesive, well-implemented solution rather than implementing every possible feature.

## Team registration
Teams must register their project and members in the [Course projects spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W5FcjhBbfc6SNVqenk_UWRYlsDjw6WO_Xrm28dM8Ke4/edit?usp=sharing)

Required information:
- Team members (2-5 people)
- Team name
- Project topic (from the list above or a custom topic)
- GitHub organization link (once created)

Note: Topics are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. Each team should choose a unique topic to avoid duplication

## Project ideas & inspiration
You can draw inspiration from previous successful projects in the [Fall 2024 Flutter Course](https://github.com/timur-harin/Fall24FlutterCourse?tab=readme-ov-file#team-projects-of-students). However, ensure your implementation is unique and incorporates all required technical components
