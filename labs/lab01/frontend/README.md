# Lab 01 - Flutter Frontend

This directory contains the Flutter implementation of three basic UI components:

1. **Profile Card**: A widget to display user information
2. **Counter App**: A simple counter application with increment/decrement functionality
3. **Registration Form**: A form with validation for user registration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. Run the app:

   ```

### Running Tests
